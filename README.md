## Project Description: Food Search Website

I have developed a user-friendly website that allows users to search for their desired food items. The website utilizes HTML and Bootstrap for responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various devices. With the integration of JavaScript, the website becomes fully functional, providing a seamless user experience.

### Key Features:

1) Food Search: Users can enter the name of the food they wish to eat into the search bar. The system will validate the input and check if the food is available in our database.

2) Display of Results: If the input matches a food item in our database, the website will display the desired food in the user interface (UI). Users can then select the displayed food item to obtain more details.

3) Error Handling: In case the food item entered by the user is not found in our database, an error message will be shown in the UI, indicating that the food is unavailable.

4) Input Validation: If a user clicks the search button without providing any input, an error message will be displayed, prompting them to enter a valid food name.

By combining the power of HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, this website delivers a visually appealing and responsive interface. Users can easily search for their desired food items and obtain relevant details, ensuring an enjoyable and hassle-free experience.
